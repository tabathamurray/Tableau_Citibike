# Analysis of August 2019 Citi Bike Data

**Overview of the analysis:** The purpose of this challenge is to show vizualizations through Tableau to determine if a similar Citi Bike program would be successful in Des Moines, Iowa.

The link to the Tableau dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tabatha.murray/viz/UCF_Tableau_CitiBike_Aug19/August2019CitiBike?publish=yes).

**Results:**

The majority of the trip duration last under 30 minutes.

It does not appear to matter if they are male or female. The duration is the same.

During the week, the most popular times are between 6:00am and 10:00am and between 4:00pm and 7:00pm. Trips are faily spreadout on the weekends.

The majority of the trips are by male subscribers during the week. Customers take roughly the same trips between male and female riders.

**Summary:**  

The below is a total summary of the August 2019 data. Most popular time for riders is between 5:00pm and 6:00pm. Subscribers make up 81% of riders, and customers make up 19%. There is a 10% data annomalie in regards to gender. With the data provided, 65% of riders are male, and 25% are female.

The top 5 start stations are also the top 5 end stations. With the duration of rides, this shows that riders stay in the same area and do not travel far.

**Suggestions:**

With Des Moines being the end goal of another program, you cannot fully gauge your decision on New York City data. I recommend pulling demographics/census for Des Moines and compare those with the age range provided. Also, see how the genders relate to New York.
